                            <p>
                                Since I was a child I have been passionate about technology, while other children were
                                watching
                                cartoons, I was usually watching @Discovery Channel or science channels. My first dream was
                                to
                                be an aerospace engineer, but life took me down other paths.

                            <p>
                                After serving in the army, I decided to pursue a police career, I graduated in Forensic
                                Investigation and Criminal Expertise and dedicated myself to public examinations. But the
                                more I
                                studied, the more I saw that this wasn't the life I wanted. So I decided to look for my way,
                                and
                                I found it!

                                I have studied many things since I entered software engineering college, in fact, there are
                                many paths in the technology area, but I believe I found my path, I am currently dedicating
                                myself to data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. <br><br> I am

                                technologies. My goal is to harness the power of data and AI to solve real-world problems
                                and make a positive impact.
